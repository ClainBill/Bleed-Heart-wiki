There are a few biomes that make up the world of <a href="/doku.php?id=start" class="wikilink1" title="start" data-wiki-id="start">Bleeding Heart</a>. The main biome that makes up the majority of land mass is the regular Planes. This terrain can vary quite a bit itself, but is too general to be able to split into sub-biomes. it is usually hilly with dark green grass but can also be quite rocky, and sometimes changes altitude rapidly.

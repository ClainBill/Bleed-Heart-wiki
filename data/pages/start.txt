====== Bleed Heart ======

==== The World ====
Bleed Heart is set in a world quite different from our own. The geography consists of a few [[biomes]], each of them darker than the last. An important detail to note, however, is that the world as known, exists in an enclosed space. Where the sky should be there is instead a vast ceiling - so high up you can't even make out its details, let alone ever reach it - and the ecosystem's source of light comes from [[Stars]] embedded in the [[Neveah]].

==== History ====
Adyna was born by a [[Justisan]] and a woman he was in charge of investigating for murdering her husband. The woman was, in fact, innocent, and was accused of the murder by the villagers who hated her for investigating the stars. They lived in a poorer town outside of the larger cities and were a tight-knit community that followed their elder's standards and beliefs.
They hated Adyna's mother for opposing those beliefs, and her husband, an outsider who came in from one of the big cities.

The Justisan realised her innocence but could not prove it. Through spending time in the village and with her he fell in love, but being a Justisan could not be with her. After Adyna was born the townspeople were angry with her. The child should not have been born.
A young boy - tempted by his mother - lured a [[beast]] into her home with a [[star|stargem]] he found in a river stream. The beast killed the woman and disappeared. Discovering the tragedy, the Justisan was left with the child.

The Justisan took the baby and fled the post. He returned to the city of operation; [[Los]], and continued to raise the child as he would have liked to do with the woman. However, he soon realised the child was not his true love.
Regretting his decision, he named the child Adyna Ccri. Ccri was the name of the woman he loved. Eventually overrun with his Justisan duties and raising a child in Los. He cracks and sells the child to a passerby who takes her to his hometown outside the walls of Los.
